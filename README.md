# AIGuard-Forging-Trust-in-the-Digital-Age

## Introduction
- AIGuard is an advanced voice analysis system designed to safeguard vulnerable populations, particularly elder citizens, from fraudulent voice-based interactions in customer service environments.
- Voice communications in customer service centers have increased exponentially, with millions of calls processed daily across financial institutions and service providers.
- Current manual screening methods are time-consuming and prone to errors, creating significant operational challenges in identifying suspicious communications.
- Elderly individuals are particularly vulnerable targets, with reported losses exceeding millions annually through deceptive voice communications.
- Traditional detection methods struggle with real-time analysis and often miss subtle manipulation tactics, especially those targetting senior citizens.
- The rise in sophisticated deceptive techniques necessitates an intelligent, automated solution for protecting vulnerable customers and ensuring secure communications.

## Problem Statement

## Research Objectives
